mastermind
==========

mastermind_game.rb is the main game itself. Running it with Ruby is all that's required.

The main idea of the program is to win at Mastermind in less than 10 tries.

mastermind_tester.rb is a version of the program designed to test how it works over a large number of games. It's currently set to test 1000 games upon running.
